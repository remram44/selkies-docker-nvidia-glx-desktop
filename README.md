This is an archive of Docker images from [selkies-project/docker-nvidia-glx-desktop](https://github.com/selkies-project/docker-nvidia-glx-desktop). Images are copied here daily with timestamped tags, allowing you to access old version or pin a specific version.

For example, you don't have to worry about your desktop suddenly [changing from Xfce to KDE](https://github.com/selkies-project/docker-nvidia-glx-desktop/commit/0bad542b55afc196009f9fad5b7d15175d7b9d11) or the container dropping support for your version of CUDA/driver.

This is here because the maintainer [does not want to keep images around](https://github.com/selkies-project/docker-nvidia-glx-desktop/issues/44) themselves, citing "security risks" and "technical debt".
